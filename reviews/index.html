      <p>Feedback from firms who use DraftCore as quiet overflow capacity — clean drafts, consistent structure, minimal back-and-forth.</p>

            <strong>Managing Partner, Boutique Litigation Firm</strong>
            <span class="rating">5/5</span>
          </div>
          <p>
            We tried the entry retainer to take pressure off the team for routine drafting. Turnaround has been consistently reliable, and the drafts land in a format that’s easy to review and finish quickly. For the cost, it’s been genuinely useful.

            <strong>Senior Associate, Mid-Sized Commercial Practice</strong>
            <span class="rating">5/5</span>
          </div>
          <p>
            The monthly retainer has slotted into our workflow smoothly. The drafting is structured, commercially sensible, and reduces the time we spend getting to a solid first version. It feels like an extra pair of hands when we need it.

            <span class="rating">4/5</span>
          </div>
          <p>
            Good value for the tier we’re on. We’ve used DraftCore for repeat drafting across a few departments and it’s helped speed up internal turnaround times. The handover is tidy and needs minimal polishing.

            <span class="rating">5/5</span>
          </div>
          <p>
            I instructed DraftCore for a more detailed medium-length agreement and the first draft came back clean and properly thought through. It saved me hours and required only minor tweaks before finalising.

          </div>
          <p>
            For longer-form drafting, this service is a real relief. The structure was consistent across the document and it was easy to review and finalise. Communication was straightforward and professional.
          </p>

          <p>
            What I value most is how seamlessly DraftCore fits in — it feels like back-office support rather than an external supplier. The documents come in a format that makes it easy to apply our branding and complete the matter internally.
