      <h2>Refunds & cancellations</h2>
      <p class="fine">Last updated: 30 Jan 2026</p>
      <p>
            DraftCore aims to be fair and practical. Refund outcomes depend on what work has been completed and whether the issue can be remedied through revisions.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Before work starts:</strong> if you cancel before we begin drafting, no fee is due (or any payment received will be refunded).</li>
            <li><strong>After work starts:</strong> if drafting has started, we may charge a pro-rata amount for time spent and work completed.</li>
            <li><strong>Quality concerns:</strong> if you believe the draft does not reflect the agreed brief, raise it promptly by email. We will use the included revision(s) to bring it in line with the brief where reasonable.</li>
            <li><strong>Scope changes:</strong> if the brief changes materially after work starts, we will confirm revised scope and any fee adjustment before continuing.</li>
            <li><strong>Expedited fees:</strong> expedited/priority fees are generally non-refundable once the expedited work window has been reserved and drafting has commenced.</li>
          </ul>
